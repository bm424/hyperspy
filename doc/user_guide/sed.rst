Scanning Electron Diffraction (SED)
***********************************

Methods to analyse scanning electron diffraction (SED) data acquired in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) are described step-by-step in this chapter. These methods are specific to the signals in the :py:class:`~._signals.sed.SEDPattern` class.

.. NOTE::

    See also the `SED tutorials <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/hyperspy/hyperspy-	demos/blob/master/electron_microscopy/SED/>`_ .


The data used throughout the following examples can be downloaded as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from urllib import urlretrieve
    >>> url = 'http://cook.msm.cam.ac.uk//~hyperspy//SED_tutorial//'
    >>> urlretrieve(url + 'GaAs_001.tif', 'GaAs_nanowire_002.rpl')

.. NOTE::

    The sample and the data used in this chapter are described in D. Johnstone et al....

Loading SED data & setting microscope parameters
------------------------------------------------


Loading
^^^^^^^^

All data are loaded with the :py:func:`~.io.load` function, as described in details in
:ref:`Loading files<loading_files>`. HyperSpy is able to import different formats,
among them ".blo" (the format used by NanoMEGAS). Below are examples for loading a single 
diffraction pattern and loading a stack of diffraction patterns.

For a single diffraction pattern:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dp = hs.load("GaAs_001.tif")
    >>> dp
    <Image, title: Image, dimensions: (|144, 144)>

For a SED dataset here stored as a stack of images:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dp = hs.load("GaAs_nanowire_002.rpl", signal_type="SED_Pattern")
    >>> dp
    <Image, title: , dimensions: (100, 30|144, 144)>


Microscope and detector parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Microscope and detector parameters are stored in the :py:attr:`~.signal.Signal.metadata` 
attribute (see :ref:`metadata_structure`). These parameters can be displayed as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dp = hs.load("GaAs_nanowire_002.rpl", signal_type="SED_Pattern")
    >>> dp.metadata


Parameters can be specified directly:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dp = hs.load("GaAs_nanowire_002.rpl", signal_type="SED_Pattern")
    >>> dp.metadata.Acquisition_instrument.SED.convergence_angle = 5.

or with the
:py:meth:`~._signals.sed.SEDPattern.set_microscope_parameters` method:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dp = hs.load("GaAs_nanowire_002.rpl", signal_type="SED_Pattern")
    >>> dp.set_microscope_parameters(convergence_angle = 5.)

or raising the gui:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dp = hs.load("GaAs_nanowire_002.rpl", signal_type="SED_Pattern")
    >>> dp.set_microscope_parameters()

.. figure::  images/SED_microscope_parameters_gui.png
   :align:   center
   :width:   400

   SED microscope parameters preferences window.

If the microscope and detector parameters are not written in the original file, some
of them are set by default. The default values can be changed in the
:py:class:`~.defaults_parser.Preferences` class (see :ref:`preferences
<configuring-hyperspy-label>`).

.. code-block:: python

    >>> hs.preferences.SED.precession_angle = 36.

or raising the gui:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> hs.preferences.gui()

.. figure::  images/SED_preferences_gui.png
   :align:   center
   :width:   400

   SED preferences window.


Pre-processing
--------------

Basic pre-processing of SED datasets involves aligning the recorded electron diffraction patterns such that all have a common center, performing background subtraction, and masking the direct beam. Methods to achieve perform these pre-processing steps are available in HyperSpy as described below.

Further image processing methods that are not specifically implemented in HyperSpy but that are available in other python libraries, most particularly Scikit-Image, can be applied to multi-dimensional datasets using the :py:meth:`~.signal.map` method. As an example, the diffraction patterns could be log scaled for visualisation as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from skimage.filters import gaussian
    >>> dp.map()


External pre-processing methods of particular relevance to analysing SED data are:

Normalisation based on total intensity
Log scaling
Gaussian blurring

Background subtraction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Background subtraction is performed primarily with two goals in mind: To make it easier to perform successful peak finding and/or to obtain accurate diffraction intensities. In the former case it is only important that the position of the peak is preserved, whereas in the latter case accurate fitting of the diffuse background to be removed is of importance.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from skimage.filters import gaussian
    >>> dp.map()


Direct beam alignment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alignment is based on determining the direct beam position, which should be invariant throughout a stack of electron diffraction patterns. The position of the direct beam is estimated using the approach described by Zaeferrer [Ref, Zaeferrer 2000] and White [Ref, White Thesis] as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> 
    >>> dp.estimate_direct_beam_position()


In brief, the py:meth:`~._signals.sed.estimate_direct_beam_position()` method first sums all diffraction patterns in the stack 


Alignment based on the direct beam position can be performed using the align_direct_beam()
method.

The align_direct_beam() method estimates the direct beam position in each SED pattern using 
the estimate_direct_beam_position() method, calculates the shift of each found position with
respect to a specified reference, and applies these shifts using the align2D() method.


Direct beam masking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A signal mask that excludes pixels in the SED patterns containing the direct beam can be generated automatically using the py:meth:`~._signals.sed.direct_beam_mask()` method. This can be useful for visualisation if the direct beam is much more intense than diffracted beams and can alleviate issues associated with saturation of the direct beam that may affect further analysis.

The py:meth:`~._signals.sed.direct_beam_mask()` method estimates the direct beam position in each SED pattern using the py:meth:`~._signals.sed.estimate_direct_beam_position()` method and masks a circular region around that position with a user specified radius, as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dp = hs.load("GaAs_nanowire_002.rpl", signal_type="SED_Pattern")
    >>> dpmask = dp * dp.direct_beam_mask(radius=6)
    >>> dpmask.plot()

.. figure:: images/SED_direct_beam_mask.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

   Automatically generated direct beam mask.


Vacuum masking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A navigation mask to exclude SED patterns acquired in vacuum from further analysis can be
generated automatically using the vacuum_mask() method. Ignoring these patterns, which do 
not contain useful information, in later analysis is efficient in terms of computation time
and can improve results from statistical methods that use all of the selected data.

The vacuum_mask() method automatically determines whether a SED pattern was acquired in
vacuum by assessing whether or not any diffraction peaks exist in the region that does not
contain the direct beam. 

The method is applied as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dp = hs.load("GaAs_nanowire_002.rpl", signal_type="SED_Pattern")
    >>> 

.. figure:: images/SED_vacuum_mask.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

   Automatically generated mask excluding SED patterns acquired in vacuum.


'Virtual' diffraction imaging
-----------------------------

'Virtual' diffraction imaging involves plotting the intensity of a sub-set of pixels in each electron diffraction pattern comprising a SED dataset, as a function of probe position. In this way, variations in the diffraction condition are mapped. Forming such 'virtual' diffraction images in HyperSpy is easy using the 'interactive' and 'ROI' functionality of the signal class as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dp = hs.load("GaAs_nanowire_002.rpl", signal_type="SED_Pattern")
    >>> 

.. figure:: images/SED_vacuum_mask.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

   Automatically generated mask excluding SED patterns acquired in vacuum.


Machine learning SED data
-------------------------

Machine learning decomposition approaches can be applied to SED data to separate diffraction signals arising from crystals that overlap in projection from the mixed diffraction patterns recorded. It has been shown that precession electron diffraction patterns are better suited to such analysis [Ref, Johnstone et al] and that separating signals in this way from SED data acquired through a tilt series can be used a basis to achieve 'scanning precession electron tomography' [Ref, Eggeman et al]. 


PCA denoising
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dp = hs.load("GaAs_nanowire_002.rpl", signal_type="SED_Pattern")
    >>> 

.. figure:: images/SED_vacuum_mask.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

   Automatically generated mask excluding SED patterns acquired in vacuum.


Separating physical patterns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dp = hs.load("GaAs_nanowire_002.rpl", signal_type="SED_Pattern")
    >>> 

.. figure:: images/SED_vacuum_mask.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

   Automatically generated mask excluding SED patterns acquired in vacuum.
